I encountered some challenges with integrating the mixItUp library as the function needed to be called after all of my portfolio items had been rendered by angular. Several resources suggested adding a timeOut, but this seemed like the lazy way out and either had the potential to fail or negatively impact the user experience. After looking into it a little more I created a directive that would broadcast once the last project loaded. I could then listen for this in the mixitup directive.</p>",
