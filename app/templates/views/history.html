  <article>
    <p>As I was moving towards a director position at AccretiveTG, I took some time to consider my career goals. While I enjoyed aspects of my position and managerial responsibilities, I was most engaged when I got my hands dirty with development work and building analytic reports in Splunk. I decided to pursue a career shift into a full time development role, but needed to add some polish to my mostly self-taught development experience. Enter code fellows, a coding bootcamp that offered a full stack javaScript course. I could capitalize on my prior front end development experience while applying better practices like object oriented and functional programming and learn how to develop in node.js. The timing worked out well, because I’d just found out I was expecting and my due date was a month after the final 401 class would wrap up. After finishing up at code fellows, I took some time off to be the primary caregiver for my child, but now I’m excited to get back into the development game.</p>

    <p>At Code Fellows I took three courses each culminating in a week long effort to design and build a functional product with a small team of class mates. I often found myself in a leadership role or acting as a TA, as my previous experience helped me troubleshoot other student’s code and avoid common beginner mistakes. While many of my CSS and HTML capabilities exceeded what was being covered in these courses, they helped me improve my file organization with MVC principals and introduced mobile first CSS as a best practice.</p>
    <p>In the 201 course everything is done with vanilla javaScript, HTML and CSS. It was a great way to break habits of relying on libraries like jQuery for DOM traversal and provided an introduction into object oriented programming in javaScript. For our final project we created a searchable board game library that worked with local storage.</p>
    <p>In 301 Code Fellows introduces libraries, frameworks and 3rd party APIs. I already had extensive experience using jQuery, but in my previous jobs I rarely worked with external APIs. For our final project we created a proxy server to work with NOAAs API and used functional programming to filter the data into low and high tide readings for different beaches in Washington State.</p>
    <p>In the 401 course we began creating our own APIs and working with single page application frameworks like angular and react for front end development. Primarily we developed express servers, but experimented with a few other node.js server modules. We used mocha to develop unit tests and created an end to end test using protractor. For our final project we developed an Angular application for our express server which interfaced with Philips Hue REST API. Our application included user authentication, multiple views and a mongoDB.</p>
    <p>After completing the Full Stack javaScript Development course at Code Fellows, I was offered a position as a 401 Teacher’s Assistant. Usually the 401 position only goes to an existing TA with experience in a 201 or 301 class, but my 401 instructor had personally recommended me. Unfortunately the timing didn’t work out, as my due date was a couple weeks into the 10 week course.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I lead a team of five graphic designers and developers creating innovative advertisements, mailers, micro sites and applications. I designed, directed and assisted in the creation of internal and external products using UX tools like moqups, axure and inVision.</p>
      <p>One of the projects I spearheaded was developing library of dynamic and customizable ads using HTML, CSS and PHP which would sanitize and accept arguments from the URL. I then designed and prototyped a URL generation interface using bootstrap that would allow clients and internal staff to quickly create, customize and preview ads from our suite. This saved our team a ton of hours that were previously spent creating custom ads for clients. Instead we could focus on expanding our ad suite and analyzing our ads for optimization.</p>
      <p>The driving force of our department’s design was big data. We processed millions of impressions per day, and needed to analyze user interaction, conversion metrics and conversion paths. We used a plethora of tools to analyze our products including Google Analytics, Visual Website Optimizer, Splunk and a proprietary advertising software. Splunk was a very powerful tool as it allowed us to analyze raw log data and helped us drive the design for our internal advertising software. I researched view creation in splunk and created several views using REGEX and SQL queries which provided valuable insight into customer behavior and interaction with our ads.</p>
      <p>I also functioned as our departments project manager. I triaged and assigned jira tickets and made sure our team kept our internal wiki updated. I managed days off and dealt with personnel issues as they came up. I also reviewed resumes, interviewed and assisted in the interviewing for other departments.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>As a creative developer, I designed and developed marketing materials using HTML, CSS, javaScript and PHP. I researched and implemented optimization software to improve our conversion rate on advertisements including Google Analytics, Optimizely, Visual Website Optimizer and Click Tale. We began long term use of VWO as it gave us the most flexibility and was one of the few products that could track interaction with flash elements.</p>
      <p>After implementing VWO on our live video player we found some weak points. I made adjustments to the UX of our player and we used the data to drive the design of the mobile interface. The company also began work on a proprietary ad tracking software. I became a product owner, built out design docs, and created the initial UX for the product. We also began creating more robust advertisements, with dynamic elements and jQuery animations. During this time we improved the CTR on our popunder ads from two to eight percent.</p>

    <p>In 2010 I moved out to the Seattle area in search of more work opportunities. After leaving Bigfork Web, I maintained them as a client working as a subcontractor. Working for myself allowed me to learn more about client acquisition and once again take on the role of project manager. During my time as a freelance web designer and developer I created multiple websites, produced advertisements and wrote some copy. One of my freelance jobs evolved into a full time job offer. Even after I began working at Accretive Technology full time, I continued freelancing on my off hours. Some of my clients included: Bigfork Web, Montana Weed Control, Expanding Your Horizons, RSM Motor Sports, Sitter City, Add3 and Accretive Technology Group.</p>

    <p>BWD was a custom web shop that catered to businesses of various size and complexity in the Flathead Valley. Our customers ranged from proprietors of drive through coffee shops creating a web presence for the first time to the National Flood Service with a very strict style guide. I was responsible for end to end concept, branding, strategy design and development helping create custom experience to grow business.</p>
    <p>I developed many of my designs into custom wordpress themes, so clients could take on ownership of their own content. Many clients were also seeking to sell their products or services online. I researched and took on the responsibility of installing, configuring and theming cart software like Magento, xCart and ViArt. Magento was by far the most robust and flexible of the cart software, and as an open source software appealed to the majority of our clients. BWD focused on quick turn around and I had a hand in producing over one hundred websites in my time there. We were also passionate about contributing to the community and volunteered several man and development hours to various organizations like Toys for Tots, Expanding Your Horizons and the Bigfork Chamber of Commerce.</p>

      <p>While University of Montana was still offering courses on building table websites, a student driven company was developing websites using HTML, Flash, javaScript, CSS and Cold Fusion.

      </h3>
      <p>After a year I was promoted to a Senior Web Designer, where in addition to designing and developing websites I began project managing. I worked directly with clients to build requirement docs, learn about their target users and get a feel for their vision. With the promotion the scope and complexity of the projects increased, and I designed the user experience for several larger scale applications interfacing with our Cold Fusion developers.</p>
      <p>As a university organization we strove to make our websites as accessible as possible to students with visual impairments. Accessibility was core to our company mission statement, so building semantic, valid sites with options to increase font-size and contrast was a priority. Semantic code also had a high impact on search engine optimization, and working with this focus provided me with an excellent foundation to consider web experience holistically from business objectives to user experience.</p>

    <p>As a student web designer, I had a 3 months of peer mentorship where I learned how to use web production software and the fundamentals of building a static website. After the mentorship, I designed and developed websites primarily for the College of Arts and Sciences, local government and nonprofits located in Missoula, MT.</p>
