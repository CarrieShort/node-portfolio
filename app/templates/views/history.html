    <p>As I moved more towards a directive position at Accretive, I realized my real passion was for development. I decided that I wanted to pursue a career change into a full time development role, and the best method seemed to be a coding bootcamp. I had extensive HTML, CSS and javaScript experience, but I'd never focused on object oriented programming. So while I was familiar with the basics, I needed a better foundation in the fundamentals of programming. The full stack javaScript course appealed to me as I felt I could capitalize on my prior experience to expand my front end development skills. At code fellows I took three courses each culminating in a week long effort to design and build a functional product with a small team of class mates. My industry experience allowed me to take a leadership role on each of the three projects. In each of my classes one of the products I pitched was selected and I was made team leader. I also took on the UX and graphic design work, since I had previous industry experience. Code Fellows gave me a better understanding of object oriented and functional programming. I aslo fleshed out my understanding of connecting the frontend to a backend API as in the 401 class we were responsible for creating multiple REST APIs and developing front ends for them. We also had the oprtunity to use multiple frameworks like angular and react.</p>

      <p>As lead creative developer, I lead a team of five graphic designers and developers creating inovative advertisements, micro sites and designing internal software. We used moqups, axure and invision to design internal products that the company's development team would execute. I designed an ad URL generation interface that would allow external clients to quickly create, customize and preview ads from a dynamic ad suite that my team created. I lead an effort to make our library of ads dynamic and customizable by accepting variables from URLs. This saved our team a ton of grind time that we used to expand our ad suite, optimize our ad templates, and inovate. Project management of work orders fell on my shoulders as our team did not have a project manager. I triaged and assigned jira tickets, made sure our team updated our internal wiki, scheduled vacations and dealt with personel issues. I reviewed resumes, interviewed and assisted in the interviewing of other departments. During this time we began to focus on our email marketing and product support materials. I helped design the email template software and build the team of email designers and developers that would utilize the software.</p>

      <p>Core Responsibilities: Project Management, UX/UI Design, Graphic Design, Ad Optimization, HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript</p>
      <p>I researched and implemented optimization software to improve our conversion rate on advertisements including optimizely, visual website optimizer and click tale. We began long term use of visual website optimizer as it gave us the most flexibility and was one of the few softwares that could track interaction with flash elements. After implementing VWO on our live video player we found some weak points. I made some UX updates to our player and we used the software to drive the design of the mobile interface. The company also began work on a proprietary ad tracking software. I became a product owner, built out design docs, and created the initial UX for the product. We also began creating more robust advertisements, with dynamic elements and jQuery animations.</p>

    <p>As a graphic designer in the Creative Department, my primary responsibility was creating banner ads. I also began creating supplimentary landing pages and microsites to increase the conversion rates of our banner ads and maintained the PHP that distributed and rotated our advertisements.</p>

    <p>In 2010 I moved out to the Seattle area in search of more work opportunities. After leaving Bigfork Web, I maintained them as a client working as a subcontractor. Working for myself allowed me to learn more about client acquisition and once again take on the role of project manager. During my time as a freelance web designer and developer I created multiple websites, produced advertisements and wrote some copy. One of my freelance jobs evolved into a full time job offer. Even after I began working at Accretive Technology full time, I continued freelancing on my off hours. Some of my clients included: Bigfork Web, Montana Weed Control, Expanding Your Horizons, RSM Motor Sports, Sitter City, Add3 and Accretive Technology Group.</p>

    <p>At Bigfork Web, I designed and built the front end website for several small businesses in the Flathead Valley. I worked with a PHP programmer to integrate dynamic content and used jQuery to implement animated features like photo galleries. I also had the opportunity to translate our custom designs into wordpress themes, so our clients could manage their website content themselves. As small businesses many clients were interested in integrating shopping carts. I took it upon myself to learn how to install, configure and theme cart software like Magento and xCart, so we could offer this service to our clients.</p>

      <p>I worked as a project manager, communicating directly with clients in the initial meet and greet and becoming the primary contact point.

    <p>As a student web designer, I had a 3 months of peer mentorship where I learned how to use web production software and the fundamentals of building a static website. After the mentorship, I designed and developed websites primarily for the college of arts and sciences and non-profits located in Missoula, MT using HTML, CSS and Flash.</p>
